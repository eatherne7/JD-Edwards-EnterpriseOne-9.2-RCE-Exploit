# JD Edwards EnterpriseOne 9.2 Remote Code Execution

<ins>Version:</ins> Tools Release < 9.2.6.4

<ins>Tested on:</ins> Redhat/Centos/Oracle Linux 7/8



<ins>Description:</ins>
Using a specially crafted HTTP POST request, any authenticated JDE user is able to bypass file upload restrictions within the Image Manager design panel located under the user personalization options. Within the GUI, you're unable to upload a JSP file, however with some modifications to the request you can upload any file and ultimately gain remote code execution as the jde web user.
